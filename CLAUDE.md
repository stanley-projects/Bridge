# AppleMapsRedirect

Android app that intercepts `maps.apple.com` links (and shared Apple Maps text) on Android and hands them off to Google Maps / Waze / any installed `geo:` handler via a chooser. Includes a manual paste-and-convert screen for cases where a link arrives as plain text the OS won't route.

- Package: `com.applemapsredirect`
- minSdk 21, targetSdk 35, Kotlin 2.0.21, AGP 8.7.3
- Two activities: `RedirectActivity` (transparent, handles intents) and `MainActivity` (manual UI)
- Core logic: `AppleMapsParser` - resolves redirects, extracts `ll` / `daddr` / `address` / `q` / `saddr` / `/place/<name>`, emits `geo:` or `google.navigation:` URIs.

## Agent Memory Protocol

Use this file as the standing project memory shared between Claude Code and Codex.

Rules:

1. Any meaningful code change, architecture decision, bug fix, regression, or workflow adjustment should be recorded here.
2. Each note should be prefixed with the agent name in brackets, for example `[Claude]` or `[Codex]`.
3. Prefer concise entries that explain what changed, why it changed, and any follow-up risk.
4. Keep older entries, including failed attempts and mistakes. Do not rewrite agent log history; append corrections and follow-up outcomes instead.
5. If the file's encoding gets damaged, normalize it back to plain ASCII or valid UTF-8 while preserving meaning.

Suggested note format:

```text
### YYYY-MM-DD
- [AgentName] What changed. Why it changed. Any follow-up note.
```

## Agent Log

### 2026-05-25
- [Claude] Initialized CLAUDE.md with project description and Agent Memory Protocol. No code changes; bootstrap only so future Claude/Codex sessions share context.
- [Codex] Added public-facing project materials: README, GitHub Pages front page in docs/index.html, and .gitignore for Android/Gradle output. Preparing repository for public GitHub publishing.
